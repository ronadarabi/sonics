# Sonics
Sonics is a project where I explore converting data into music. While many of these ideas came from many sources, and I do not claim them as my own, the execution is uniquely mine. 

### Time 
I used the following chart to convert the digits to notes, based on the selected scale. 

| Major Scale  | 0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| ----------- | ---- |---- |---- |---- |---- |---- |---- |---- |- |-- |
| C  | C | D | E | F | G | A | B | C | D |E |
| D  | D | E | F# | G | A | B | C | D | E | F# |
| E  | E | F# | G# | A | B | C# | D | E | F# | G# |
| F  | F | G | A | Bb | C | D | E | F | G | A | 
| G  | G | A | B | C | D | E | F# | G | A | B |
| A  | A | B | C# | D | E | F# | G# | A | B | C# |
| B  | B | C# | D# | E | F# | G# | A# | B | C# | D# |
